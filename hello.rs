// This is how you wirte a comment in rust
/* Same syntax as C*/

// fn main(), fn is short for function

// Do rustc "fileName" on the terminal to compile the program
// Executable is fileName.exe, runs using ./fileName

// Cargo new helloProject creates a new directory with your code and a .gitignore
// Cargo run to execute your file
// Cargo practically auto compiles, unlike rustc
